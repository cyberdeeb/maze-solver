# Maze Solver with Python and Tkinter

## Project Overview

This project implements a graphical user interface (GUI) using Python's Tkinter library to generate and solve mazes. It combines visual programming with algorithmic problem-solving, providing a hands-on experience in implementing maze generation and solving algorithms.

## Features

* **Random Maze Generation:** Generates mazes of customizable sizes using a randomized algorithm.
* **GUI with Tkinter:** Provides a user-friendly interface for visualizing the maze and its solution.
* **Maze Solving Algorithm:** Implements an algorithm (e.g., Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, or A*) to find a path from the start to the end of the maze.
* **Visual Solution Display:** Highlights the solution path within the generated maze.

## Technologies Used

* **Python:** The primary programming language.
* **Tkinter:** Python's standard GUI toolkit for creating the graphical interface.
